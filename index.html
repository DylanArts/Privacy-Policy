  <h1>Focally – Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="muted">Last updated: August 10, 2025</p>

  <p>
    Focally (“we”, “our”, or “us”) respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains
    what data our mobile app (“App”) accesses, how that data is used, and your choices.
    This policy is intended to meet Google Play’s requirements for apps that request
    sensitive permissions such as the microphone (<code>RECORD_AUDIO</code>).
  </p>

  <h2>Data We Access &amp; Why</h2>
  <h3>Microphone (RECORD_AUDIO)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To analyse your voice during in‑app exercises (e.g., singing/humming) and give you real‑time feedback.</li>
    <li><strong>What is processed:</strong> Short snippets of audio from your device’s microphone.</li>
    <li><strong>Where processed:</strong> On your device. Raw audio is not sent to our servers.</li>
    <li><strong>Retention:</strong> Raw microphone audio is processed ephemerally and not stored by us. If you choose to save a recording, it is stored locally on your device unless you explicitly share it.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Diagnostics &amp; App Activity (optional)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>We may collect basic, non‑sensitive diagnostics (e.g., crash logs, anonymized usage counts) to improve stability. These do not include microphone audio.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How We Use Data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide core App functionality (audio analysis and feedback).</li>
    <li>Improve performance and reliability (diagnostics only).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>No selling:</strong> We do not sell your personal data.</li>
    <li><strong>No advertising sharing:</strong> We do not share microphone audio or analysis with advertisers.</li>
    <li><strong>Service providers:</strong> We may use trusted providers (e.g., hosting, authentication) who process limited data on our behalf under confidentiality obligations.</li>
    <li><strong>Legal:</strong> We may disclose information if required by law.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Your Choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Permissions:</strong> You can allow or deny the microphone permission. Without it, audio features will be disabled.</li>
    <li><strong>Control:</strong> You can revoke permissions at any time in your device settings.</li>
    <li><strong>Account &amp; deletion:</strong> If the App supports accounts, you may request deletion of your account data by contacting us.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Children</h2>
  <p>The App is not directed to children under the age of digital consent in your region. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children without appropriate consent.</p>

  <h2>Changes</h2>
  <p>We may update this Policy from time to time. We will post the updated version here and change the “Last updated” date.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have questions about this Policy or your data, contact us at <a href="mailto:softwaretype@gmail.com">softwaretype@gmail.com</a>.</p>
